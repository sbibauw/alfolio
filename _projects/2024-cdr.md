## AI Tutoring for Language Learning: Reference corpus, written fluency and developmental effects

This research project aims to explore conversational artificial intelligence (AI) use in language learning,
specifically focusing on French learners. The study pursues three research objectives:

1. developing a reference corpus of teacher-student chatroom conversations to train and analyze AI tutors,
2. establishing norms for writing fluency in L2 text chat,
3. measuring the effects of AI tutoring on writing fluency.

### Funding

Funded by [Fonds de la recherche scientifique](https://www.frs-fnrs.be) (FNRS) under the CDR scheme for 2024-2025.

### Product

Developing a web interface for language learning tutoring via text chat and systematic data collection, **[LanguageLab](https://languagelab.be/)**.
