  Conversational agents are seen as a way to offer an anxiety-free L2 practice
  environment for learners, in the hope that it would produce similar
  proficiency improvements as those obtained in a chat with a human
  interlocutor. Various approaches have been used to develop conversational
  agents: pattern matching (from a knowledge base obtained either manually, from
  a corpus or with crowdsourcing), AI planners and script-based frameworks.
  However current agents still present important shortcomings for applications
  in language learning and very few researchers have ever evaluated their impact
  on L2 development. Following Petersen’s (2010) successful experiment, we will
  present a design for a task-based agent that would provide semantically and
  pragmatically consistent answers inside a specific goal-oriented conversation
  with a learner.
