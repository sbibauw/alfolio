  This breakout session provides a brief overview of scientific research into the use of conversational AI (such as ChatGPT) in language education. The session will consist of two parts. In the first part, you will learn about the different applications of conversational AI for language learners and teachers. Moreover, you will gain insight into the effectiveness of conversational AI for language learning. In the second part, we take a closer look at how technologies such as chatbots and generative language models work and how they are developed and evaluated.
