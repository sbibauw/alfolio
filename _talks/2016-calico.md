abstract: >-
  Dialogue-based computer-assisted language learning (CALL) encompasses
  applications that allow a learner to practice a foreign language by carrying a
  conversation with a computer through unconstrained input. Such systems,
  whether speech or text-based, present various challenges to the CALL
  developer, both with the instructional design (degree of openness of the
  interaction, types of prompt, etc.) and the technological design (rules-driven
  vs. data-driven system, complexity level of the natural language processing,
  etc.). We propose a general task design framework for dialogue-based CALL, and
  align it with recommendations for natural language processing (NLP) techniques
  to tackle such challenge.
